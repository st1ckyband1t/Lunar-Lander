# Lunar-Lander
The Lunar Lander problem is a reinforcement learning challenge where an agent controls a spacecraft to land safely on a designated pad. It learns to balance thrust, fuel efficiency, and stability while avoiding crashes. The goal is to master precise landings through trial and error, optimizing for smooth descent and minimal fuel usage. ðŸš€
